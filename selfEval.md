# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
**Surprisingly not that much. This is something that made sense to me, which is nice.**
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
**Note taking has been super helpful. It's nice to refer back to specifically for things we did awhile ago and what syntax they need. I need to go back and maybe highlight some important things. I find myself taking helpful notes when I am going through it solo. Although, I realized I wished I would've taken notes during our class meetings, because I think I will just remember, but I don't.**
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
**Googling has not been easiest for me. A lot of the answers online I don't understand. Youtube videos have helped, and just working through it on my own. And of course asking for help**
